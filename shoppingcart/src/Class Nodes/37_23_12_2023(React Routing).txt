- Routing is a technique used in web applications to configure user and SEO friendly URL.
- It allows to query any content directly from URL.
- It enables Ajax requests, which allows to load new details into page without reloading the page.
- It enable SPA [Single Page Application] approach, where user can stay on one page and can access everything into page.
- It can enable partial postbacks and asynchronous rendering.
- Routing can be both server side or client side.
- React JS routing library is not a part of its core library.
- React routing library have 2 major versions
        a) V5    [React Router DOM 5] upto 17x of react
        b) V6    [React Router DOM 6] from 18x of react

Note: V6 is a complete re-write of routing library.

Setup Routing:
1. Install react-router-dom library

    >npm i  react-router-dom

    https://reactrouter.com/en/main

2. Router DOM components you can import and directly implements in application

    <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
    <Route>
    <Link>
    <Outlet>
    etc..

3. Routing is configured in startup component and it allows to access other components and render into startup component.

Router Components:

1. BrowserRouter  
- It is a provider  for routes in virtual DOM.
- Provider is a component of DI [Dependency Injection] which is used to location your resource in memory.
- BrowserRouter can translate the virtual DOM routes into actual DOM location object.

2. Routes
- It is a component for configuring collection of routes.
- It is used to construct a "Route Table".

3. Route
- It is used to configure a route inside routes collection.
- Route defines the request path and element to render as response.

Syntax:
    <BrowserRouter>
        <Routes>
           <Route  path=""  element=""> </Route>
           <Route  path=""  element=""> </Route>        
        </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>

- Route path comprises meta characters and request name.

        path="/"        It is used configure default to render
        path="*"        It is used to configure the content to render when requested
                    component not found.
        path="name"    It is used to request specific

4. Link
- It is used to configure a Hyperlink that navigates to specific path in routing.

        <Link  to="path"> Text | Image </Link>


Ex:
1. Create a new react app

    > npx  create-react-app   react-routing-demo

2. Install router dom

    > npm i  react-router-dom   --save

3. Go to "app.js"

import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import { BrowserRouter, Link, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Login } from './components/login/login';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
       
        <BrowserRouter>
            <header>
              <h1>Shopper.</h1>
              <nav>
                 <Link to='/'>Home</Link> <span></span>
                 <Link to='kids'>Kids</Link> <span></span>
                 <Link to='men'>Men's Fashion</Link> <span>  </span>
                 <Link to='login'> Login </Link>
              </nav>
            </header>
            <hr />
            <Routes>
                <Route path='/' element={<><h2>Home</h2><p>Year end sale 40% OFF</p></>}></Route>
                <Route path='kids' element={<><h2>Kids Fashion</h2><p>30% OFF on kidswear</p></>} ></Route>
                <Route path='men' element={<><h2>Men's Fashion</h2><p>Winter wear, Shoes, Jeans..</p></>} ></Route>
                <Route path='login' element={<Login />} />
                <Route path='*' element={<><code>Not Found: Path you requested not found</code></>}></Route>
            </Routes>
        </BrowserRouter>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
