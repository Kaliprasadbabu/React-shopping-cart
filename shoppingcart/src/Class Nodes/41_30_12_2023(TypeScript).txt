FAQ: What are the issues with JavaScript?
Ans:
 - It is not a strongly typed language.
 - It is not implicitly strictly typed.
 - It is not an OOP language.
 - No dynamic polymorphism.
 - No code level security.
 - Not easy to extend.

                               TypeScript

- It is strictly typed mode of JavaScript.
- Anders Hejlberg introduced "TypeScript" as language. He is the architect of language called "C#" [.net]. [Microsoft]
- Google started a language called "atscript" in early 2013, to provide an alternative for JavaScript.
- Google started using TypeScript as language for its framework "Angular".
- TypeScript is transcompiled into JavaScript.
- TypeScript is just an alternative for JavaScript, it is not replacement.

Features:
- It is strongly typed.
- It is strictly typed.
- It is an OOP language.
- It supports complete extensibility, reusability, sepration.
- It supports code level security etc..


TypeScript Architecture:

1. TypeScript Core Compiler
 - It verifies the code syntax.
 - It checkes the data type.
 - It manages input and output operations
 - It verifies code blocks and conversions of data.
   
  [core.ts, program.ts, scanner.ts, parser.ts, emitter.ts, checker.ts]

2. Standalone Compiler
 - It transcompiles the typescript code into javascript.
 - Browser can interpret only JavaScript.

  [tsc.ts]

3. Language Service
- A service is pre-defined business logic used by compilers to verify the code and compile the code.
- Service is a set of factories.
- Factory is a set of functions and values.

 [services.ts]


4. TS Server
- It hosts the TS programs.
- It compiles them and manages request / response.

[tsserver.ts]


5. VS Shim
- It makes the language platform neutral.
- It can run on any enivronment and device.
   
[shims.ts]

    code => translated => native code   => platform dependent.
                       [un managed]

    code => translated => Managed Code => platform independent
                         [shims.ts]


6. Managed Language Service
- It is the code suitable for every OS service.
- It comprises of set of libraries that can run on every device and in any environment.


Setup and Install TypeScript on your PC:

1. Open command prompt

2. Run the command

    > npm   install  typescript  -g

3. Check the version

    > tsc  -v

4. Create a project for Typescript
   
        D:\ts-project

    > npm  init -y                [package.json]
    > tsc  -init                    [tsconfig.json]


5. Add folders
    - public
    - src

6. Add a TS file

    index.ts

let uname:string = "John";
let age:number = 24;

function PrintDetails():string
{
    return `Hello ! ${uname} your age ${age}`;
}

7. Transcompile

    > tsc  index.ts

8.  Add Index.js to HTML page

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script src="../src/index.js"></script>
    <script>
        function bodyload(){
            document.querySelector("p").innerHTML = PrintDetails();
        }
    </script>
</head>
<body onload="bodyload()">
    <p></p>
</body>
</html>
